A sort of flash-card language learning program. 

It is a personal program of Turkish words and phrases I learned and used to help with memorizing them. This was designed with
a database, but I exported the csv and saved it in the repo if anyone is interested in using it.

Note: 
This was done on a MAC, so the code at line 199 in flash_turk will need to be adjusted for windows 
(I think to os.system('cls'))
